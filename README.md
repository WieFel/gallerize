# gallerize

[![pub.dev](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/gallerize?logo=dart)](https://pub.dev/packages/gallerize)

Flutter package for creating a demo of your package/app.

## âš  In development!

This project is still a work in progress, not yet ready for production.


## Purpose of this package

The **gallerize** package can be used to demonstrate what YOUR package/widget is for. It is inspired by [Flutter Gallery](https://gallery.flutter.dev/) ([see repo on GitHub](https://github.com/flutter/gallery)), therefore the name "gallerize".

**gallerize** allows you to take your own package/widget and create an app around it which provides a description, a preview and exemplary source code, just like [Flutter Gallery](https://gallery.flutter.dev/) does it for the material and cupertino widgets. **gallerize** saves you from creating boilerplate code for creating a gallery app structure, importing themes etc.
